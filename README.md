# Farm Stand App

This is a small project called Farm Stand App. It is a simple application built to experiment with CRUD operations using Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose. The application allows you to add, edit, delete, view all products, and even filter products. Please note that this application has no styling as it is primarily for backend experimentation.

## Overview of the Code

The codebase is structured around Express for handling server-side operations, MongoDB as the database, and Mongoose for object modeling. CRUD operations are implemented for product management.
